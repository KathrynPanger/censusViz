Before the church of christ study, this study came out examining the four hazardous-waste
landfills, which is cited in the church of Christ study.
Their methods were as follows:
"To obtain information on communities surrounding these
landfills, Bureau of the Census, Department of Commerce,
officials located the sites on maps that delineated census
areas and provided 1980 racial and economic data for census areas
in which the landfills are located and other census areas that
have borders within about 4 miles. Bureau of the Census
officials also provided similar data for the county and State
where the landfills are located."

Findings:
"Based on 1980 census data at three of the four sites--
Chemical Waste Management, Industrial Chemical Company, and the
Warren County PCB Landfill-- the majority of the population in
census areas (areas within a county such as a township or sub-
division) where the landfills are located is Black. Also, at all
four sites the Black population in the surrounding census areas
has a lower mean income than the mean income for all races com-
bined and represents the majority of those below poverty level
(the poverty level was $7,412 for a family of four in the 1980
census)."
